              With a rapidly increasing number of young Australians reporting that money worries affect their mental
              wellbeing, financial education isn't optional; it's essential. We help bridge the gap by combining
              financial literacy with psychology and wellbeing education, giving you the knowledge and confidence to
              stay one step ahead.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Building money skills early creates strong foundations for life. When young people learn to budget, save,
              and understand their money mindset, they gain more than financial literacyâ€”they gain confidence,
              resilience, and independence.
